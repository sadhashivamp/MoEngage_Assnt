Anime Review System
1. Build a web application to search anime by genre using ani API
(https://aniapi.com/docs/) and add reviews. This web app should have sign up for
new users and login for existing users.
2. When a user logs in, the home page should have an anime search option. This
search option should have the ability to search by genre, titles, and description.
3. The search result should display at least the following details per anime:
a. Anime name/title
b. Trailer url
c. genres
d. description
e. Current rating (rating based on point no.4)
f. Season year
g. No.of episodes
4. When the user clicks on an anime, the new page should open with all possible
anime information. The user should have the ability to add reviews for an anime
and this should be saved in a hosted database (These reviews are different from
the reviews that are present on ani API). Whenever someone opens an anime
page, the reviews also should be shown on the anime info page.
5. The review should contain a rating from 1-5 and a description.

The application should have the following pages
1. Login/Signup Page
2. Search Page
3. Anime page along with existing reviews pulled from the hosted database. And
also a section to add a review.
What to submit
1. Please send us the video of the working demo of the application.
2. Please send us the code.
We'll prefer if this can be hosted on any free hosting server instead of localhost.
